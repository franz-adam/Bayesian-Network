    "## Project Report\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I undertake two primary objectives: \n",
    "1. I perform a **probabilistic cybersecurity threat assessment using Bayesian networks and inference techniques** to model and predict potential risks for a financial institution. The results indicate that Bayesian inference effectively captures the complex interactions within the threat landscape, enabling the financial institution to proactively address vulnerabilities and enhance its overall security posture.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "2. I evaluate **currency hedging strategies employing Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling methods**, specifically Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings, comparing their convergence speeds and accuracy against traditional variable elimination-based inference. The findings suggest that in the context of our problem both sampling techniques demonstrate equal performance in terms of convergence speed and approximation to exact inference results."

    "## 1 - Probabilistic Cybersecurity Threat Assessment \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I design a Bayesian network to effectively model and analyze cybersecurity threats for **Global Bank**, a fictional financial institution. The objective is to assess the probability of sensitive customer data being exfiltrated by a cybercriminal organization known as **CyberSpectre**. This analysis will help the bank understand various risk factors and the effectiveness of their defensive strategies under different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian network I develop will represent a structured approach to quantify the uncertainties associated with cyber threats. It will include nodes representing different elements such as the recruitment of cybercriminals, acquisition of hacking tools, insider threats, and the readiness of the cybersecurity response team. The relationships between these nodes are defined by conditional probabilities, which reflect the likelihood of one event occurring given the state of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial part of the project involves setting up the Bayesian network and utilizing inference techniques to compute marginal and conditional probabilities. This will enable me to answer critical questions about the security of the bank’s data under various conditions, such as the impact of neutralizing advanced hacking tools or increasing the alertness of the cybersecurity team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Markov Chain Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Further into the project, I will enhance the analysis by employing two **Monte Carlo Markov Chain** (MCMC) techniques, specifically **Gibbs** and **Metropolis-Hastings sampling methods**. These sampling approaches will allow us to approximate the probability distributions of our network's nodes when direct inference becomes computationally impractical or inefficient."

The network allows us to model the probabilistic relationships between different events that can affect the bank’s cybersecurity.

By understanding these dependencies, we can better prepare and potentially prevent security incidents.\n",

    "## 2 - Hedging Against Currency Risk in International Portfolios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In the previous project, we utilized Bayesian inference techniques to analyze the effectiveness of different credit risk management strategies. However, in this project, we focus on the optimization of currency hedging strategies for a hedge fund with substantial international investments, shifting our approach to MCMC sampling methods. Often, inference is not computationally feasible or efficient in complex probabilistic models due to the high dimensionality and non-linear dependencies involved, prompting the need for sampling techniques to estimate the distributions effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Effective management of currency risk is paramount in international finance, where exchange rate volatility can erase gains or amplify losses. This project evaluates various hedging strategies designed to mitigate the financial impact of adverse currency movements on an international investment portfolio. By analyzing different strategies under a range of economic scenarios, I aim to identify the most effective approach for managing currency exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategies Evaluated:**\n",
    "- **Strategy A (Forward Contracts)**: This strategy involves using forward contracts to lock in future exchange rates, providing predictability and protection against depreciation in foreign currencies.\n",
    "- **Strategy B (Currency Options)**: Options provide flexibility by offering protection against downside risk while allowing participation in favorable currency movements.\n",
    "- **Strategy C (Currency Swaps)**: Swaps allow the fund to manage multiple currency exposures simultaneously by exchanging cash flows in different currencies, which can be tailored to the needs of specific investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic Interaction Between Strategies:**\n",
    "- **AvB (Forward Contracts vs. Currency Options)**: This measures the effectiveness of forward contracts against currency options in scenarios where one method may offer greater cost efficiency or risk reduction.\n",
    "- **BvC (Currency Options vs. Currency Swaps)**: This comparison assesses whether options or swaps provide better long-term stability and cost-effectiveness in managing diverse portfolio risks.\n",
    "- **CvA (Currency Swaps vs. Forward Contracts)**: This evaluates whether swaps could be more effective than forwards in certain market conditions, particularly in terms of handling complex risk exposures across various currencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian Network Setup:**\n",
    "A Bayesian network will be constructed to model the dependencies and performance outcomes of each hedging strategy under different economic conditions. The nodes in the network represent:\n",
    "- The effectiveness of each strategy (`A`, `B`, `C`) under normal conditions.\n",
    "- The outcomes of these strategies when pitted against each other in controlled simulations (`AvB`, `BvC`, `CvA`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic Techniques for Estimation:**\n",
    "Due to the complex and often non-linear interactions between market factors and hedging outcomes, traditional analytical methods may be insufficient. Therefore, I will employ two Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques to estimate the performance distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gibbs Sampling**: This method will be used for scenarios where the dependencies between variables are conditional on others being fixed, which is typical in the intertwined nature of financial instruments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Metropolis-Hastings Sampling**: This technique will be utilized for its robustness in scenarios with more complex or less predictable dependencies. It is particularly useful in exploring the efficacy of strategies across a broader range of market conditions, where prior distributions are not well understood or are highly irregular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison of Techniques:**\n",
    "The effectiveness of Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampling methods will be compared to determine which provides more accurate and computationally efficient estimations. This comparison will help in choosing the appropriate method for ongoing risk management and strategy adjustments.\n"

    "### Setting Probabilities and Implementing the Bayesian Network\n",
    "\n",
    "In our hedging strategy optimization project, we model the performance and interactions of different hedging strategies against currency fluctuations using a Bayesian Network. This network is crucial for capturing the complex relationships and dependencies between the strategies under various market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic Definitions:**\n",
    "- **`A`, `B`, `C`**: These nodes represent the effectiveness levels of Forward Contracts, Currency Options, and Currency Swaps, respectively. Each node has a prior distribution reflecting the potential performance of the strategy across four tiers of effectiveness.\n",
    "- **`AvB`, `BvC`, `CvA`**: These nodes measure the comparative effectiveness of the strategies against each other in simulated market scenarios. The outcomes are probabilistically determined based on the relative performance levels of the strategies involved.\n",

    "### Gibbs Sampling Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Gibbs Sampling is a MCMC technique used to generate samples from a complex, multidimensional probability distribution when direct sampling is challenging. This method is particularly useful in Bayesian networks like ours, where the joint distribution of all nodes (variables) is complex and not easily factorizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foundation of Gibbs Sampling:**\n",
    "Gibbs Sampling operates by sequentially sampling from the conditional distributions of each variable, given the current values of all other variables in the system. Mathematically, for a set of variables $X = \\{X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\}$, the Gibbs sampler updates each variable $X_i$ in turn, according to the distribution $P(X_i \\mid X_{-i})$, where $X_{-i}$ represents all variables except $X_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with some initial values for the variables $X^{(0)} = \\{x_1^{(0)}, x_2^{(0)}, \\ldots, x_n^{(0)}\\}$.\n",
    "2. **Iterative Sampling**:\n",
    "   - For each iteration $t$, update each variable $X_i$ by sampling from its conditional distribution given the current values of the other variables: $x_i^{(t+1)} \\sim P(X_i \\mid X_1 = x_1^{(t)}, \\ldots, X_{i-1} = x_{i-1}^{(t+1)}, X_{i+1} = x_{i+1}^{(t)}, \\ldots, X_n = x_n^{(t)})$.\n",
    "   - This step is repeated for all variables, forming one full sweep through all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convergence Properties**:\n",
    "- Under regularity conditions, the sequence of samples $\\{X^{(t)}\\}$ generated by Gibbs Sampling converges to the target distribution as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. The samples thus obtained can be used to approximate expectations, probabilities, and other statistical properties of the target distribution.\n",
    "- The effectiveness of convergence depends on the nature of the dependencies between variables. Strong dependencies can lead to slow mixing times, meaning more iterations may be needed for the samples to approximate the true distribution well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Implementation:**\n",
    "The following Python function, `Gibbs_sampler`, performs a single iteration of the Gibbs sampling algorithm.\n",

    "Metropolis-Hastings (MH) is another MCMC technique for sampling from a probability distribution when direct sampling is not feasible. It is especially useful in scenarios where the probability distribution is high-dimensional and does not decompose conveniently. This might not necessarily be the case in our Bayesian network, however it is great practice to implement this technique from scratch to better understand the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foundation of Metropolis-Hastings:**\n",
    "The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generates a sequence of samples approximating the target distribution by creating a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution. The algorithm accomplishes this through a two-step process involving proposal distribution and acceptance probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proposal Distribution (Q):** This is a function that suggests a candidate state $x'$ from the current state $x$, where $Q(x'|x)$ is the probability of proposing $x'$ given $x$.\n",

    "   Here, $P(x)$ and $P(x')$ are the target densities of the current and proposed states, respectively. If $x'$ is not accepted, the chain remains in state $x$.\n",

    "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",
    "- **Initialization:** Start from an arbitrary initial state $x^{(0)}$.\n",
    "- **Iteration:** For each iteration $t$:\n",

    "  - Calculate the acceptance probability $A(x^{(t)}, x')$.\n",

    "Gibbs Sampling converged in $22429$ iterations, while MH Sampling took $23119$ iterations to converge. The convergence rate indicates that Gibbs sampling is slightly more efficient in this context, as it required fewer iterations to stabilize. However, MH sampling exhibited a high rejection rate ($18238$), which is typical due to its reliance on acceptance criteria. This highlights a key difference: MH can explore the state space more broadly but at the cost of higher rejection rates and potentially slower convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Posterior Distribution Accuracy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Gibbs and MH sampling produced posterior distributions that closely matched the exact inference results obtained from variable elimination. This demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of MCMC methods in approximating complex posterior distributions. The slight differences in the posterior probabilities reflect the inherent stochastic nature of the sampling methods and the influence of their respective convergence behaviors.\n",

    "- Metropolis-Hastings results: $[0.259752, 0.427894, 0.312354]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sampling methods approximate the true posterior well, but Gibbs sampling shows a slightly closer match to the exact inference result, which is corroborated by its faster convergence and lower computational cost in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparative analysis demonstrates that both Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampling methods are effective for approximating posterior distributions within Bayesian networks. In the context of our specific hedging strategy project, both sampling methods exhibited similar convergence speeds. This could be due to the lack of high dimensionality for our problem. However, for more complex applications it is important to monitor different  metrics such as rejection rates and convergence speed to evaluate each method and choose the most appropriate technique based on the observed performance and project requirements."
